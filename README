This is the official README for Project December

Running the web application (for development):

This web application was built utilizing a Linux distribution known as Ubuntu. The version of Ubuntu utilized is 22.04. For Mac developers, Mac has optimized support for sudo and git controls. However, Windows users may resort to using WSL, a Linux environment supported for Windows users or possily a VM.

The frontend of this application was built using ReactJS (JavaScript), and Tailwind CSS as the framework. Node Packet Manager (npm) and NodeJS, is utilized to handle necessary dependencies.

For development, ensure that a Linux environment is utilized, and NodeJS is properly installed on your local machine.

First, clone the repository within your local computer:

git clone https://github.com/yeyadude7/Project_December.git

To run the web application, open the repository folder within a IDE/terminal, and cd into frontend folder (called webapp):

cd webapp

From here, install any necessary dependencies within the folder, and run the development server:

npm install
npm start

To run the server locally, go into the server/.env file and insert information for your postgresql database.

Then open a new terminal seperate from the web application, cd into backend folder (called server):

cd server

Install any necessary dependencies within the folder:

npm install

If this is your first time setting up the server there are commands to help.

To set up the database schema:

npm run setup-db

To populate dummy data:

npm run seed-db

To reset the database (recreate schema and populate data):

npm run reset-db

Unit-tests can be run using:

npm test

From here run the development server:

node server.js
